People often point out that our name has got a typo. There is a lowercase 'e' instead of a capital 'E' in your name {{ site.title }} ?

<strong><blue><em>Re</em>P</blue><blueinvt><em>A</em>I</blueinvt><blue>R</blue></strong>

Does it make a good sense? lol.

We did that primarily because it has a more appealing look.

Look. Your eyes can't skip the odd one out, impressing upon you our true goal !!!
