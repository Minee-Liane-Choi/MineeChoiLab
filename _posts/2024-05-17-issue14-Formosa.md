Her Excellency Sandy Wang, the Chairman of Formosa Group, along with executives from Formosa, made an official visit to KAIST BCS.

On May 13, 2024, KAIST and Formosa agreed to establish mid- to long-term collaborations focusing on stem cell and gene-editing technologies, in partnership with Chang Gung University and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. The {{ site.title }} lab will take part in the joint R&D programme between KAIST and Formosa.

Formosa Group, a leading Taiwanese conglomerate, primarily operates in the chemical industry but has expanded its interests to include biotechnology, electronics, and healthcare. Established in 1954 by Wang Yung-ching and his brother Wang Yung-tsai, the group has since become one of the world's largest conglomerates and a top global producer of polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
