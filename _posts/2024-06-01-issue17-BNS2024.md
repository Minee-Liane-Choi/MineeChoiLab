Minee delivered a lecture on 'Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy (CLEM)' at the British Neuropathological Society (BNS) Summer School 2024.

The BNS Summer School is held every two years. It was founded in the early 1960s by Professor Payling Wright, who felt that neuropathologists and neuroscientists were not getting together enough to discuss the science of their subjects. Several research bodies were persuaded to sponsor the School, and the first was held at Wye College in 1965. The BNS Summer School is one of the best-remembered scientific events in the neuroscience calendar, allowing a very informal mix of workers from basic, veterinary and clinical neuroscience. An excellent scientific content with internationally renowned speakers is matched by a fantastic venue, a restful environment, and a beautiful garden combining to facilitate small-group discussions.

For more information, including event dates and details, you can visit the official BNS website.
