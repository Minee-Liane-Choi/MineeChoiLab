EunJin and SeungJu attended SfN 2023 and gave an oral presentation on our latest research entitled "In-silico paradigm to pinpoint mechanistic subtypes for therapeutics in Parkinsonâ€™s disease".
Our young scientists did a fantastic job at SfN 2023, showcasing the Team {{ site.team }}'s collaborative work to the world's most serious community in neuroscience.

Well done, guys !!!
