On May 13, 2024, KAIST and Formosa agreed to establish mid- to long-term collaborations focusing on stem cell and gene-editing technologies, in partnership with Chang Gung University and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. The {{ site.title }} lab will take part in the joint R&D programme between KAIST and Formosa Group.

Formosa Group, a leading Taiwanese conglomerate, primarily operates in the chemical industry but has expanded its interests to include biotechnology, electronics, and healthcare. Established in 1954 by Wang Yung-ching and his brother Wang Yung-tsai, the group has since become one of the world's largest conglomerates and a top global producer of polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
