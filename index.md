# New approaches for brain repair

The {{ site.title }} Lab is a team of researchers at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) dedicated to making human neurodegenerative disease more curable than yesterday. The ultimate hope is that by better understanding of the molecular and cellular origins of neurodegenerative diseases, we will be able to take a more strategic approach to the development of novel therapies.
<br>

We aim to build a personalized therapeutic platform to solve the three major problems in neurodegenerative diseases.
<br>
<ol>
  <li>Uniqueness of the human brain </li>
  <li>Clinically individually variable </li>
  <li>Causes mostly unknown</li>
</ol>

Our therapeutic platform utilizes the following two technical advances.
<br>

<ol>
  <li>Patient-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, which allows the adoption of the “disease in a dish” paradigm to profile an individual’s brain cells and define the mechanism driving their own diseases</li>
  <li>Machine learning, which can capture and understand disease heterogeneity, and ultimately generate a predictive model for an individual patient</li>
</ol>
