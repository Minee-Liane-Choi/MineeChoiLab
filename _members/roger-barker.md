Roger Barker is the Professor of Clinical Neuroscience and Honorary Consultant in Neurology at the University of Cambridge and at Addenbrooke's Hospital. He trained at Oxford and London and has been in his current position since 2000, after completing an MRC Clinician Scientist Fellowship.

He co-ordinated the TRANSEURO project looking at fetal cell grafting in patients with early Parkinson's Disease (PD) and is now leading a new stem cell trial in PD, STEM-PD. He is a Director of the ISSCR and is the Lead Academic Scientist on the ADDI in Cambridge.
