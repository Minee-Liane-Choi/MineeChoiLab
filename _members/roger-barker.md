Professor. Roger Barker is a clinical neuroscientist and an honorary consultant in Neurology at the University of Cambridge and at Addenbrooke's Hospital. He trained at Oxford and London and has been in his current position since 2000, after completing an MRC Clinician Scientist Fellowship.

Roger combines basic research looking at novel therapies to treat chronic neurodegenerative disorders of the brain with clinically-based work aimed at better defining such disorders. He co-ordinated the TRANSEURO project looking at fetal cell grafting in patients with early Parkinson's Disease (PD) and is now leading a new stem cell trial in PD, STEM-PD. He is a Director of the ISSCR and is the Lead Academic Scientist on the ADDI in Cambridge.
