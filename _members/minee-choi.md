Minee is a neurophysiologist specialising in neurodegenerative diseases. She is an assistant professor at the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at KAIST. She is also an Honorary Fellow of UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and the Francis Crick Institute, UK. <br>

After obtaining BA and MMSc from Hanyang University, she was awarded Cambridge Overseas Trust Scholarship and earned her PhD in Clinical Neurosciences from the University of Cambridge in 2013 (supervised by Prof. RogerBarker). After her doctorate, Minee moved to University College London(UCL) and started research as a post-doctoral research fellow (John Wood’s lab in 2013 – 2014, Sonia Gandhi’s lab in 2014 – 2022). She was on a laboratory secondment at the Francis Crick Institute as a research scientist (2017 – 2022). KAIST appointed Minee as an assistant professor as of Feb 2023.
 
Minee’s research interest is understanding the mechanisms of protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Her research aims to dissect the cellular mechanism of neurodegeneration and develop apersonalized therapeutic platform for AD and PD. She extensively utilizes patient-derived pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) systems, molecular models for mitochondrial dysfunction/protein aggregation and machine learning.

Minee was awarded the Amogen Rose Prize 2010, a best PhD student award of the department of clinical neuroscience, University of Cambridge. The British Royal Society of Biology acknowledged her achievements in neurodegeneration and nominated her as a new full member in 2019. Minee represented the post-doctoral fellows of the British Neuroscience Association in the committeefor BNA 2021 conference (2021). She also joined the grant and fellowship committee of the Athena Swan at the Crick Institute (2019 - 2022), the British female scientist empowerment programme. She has been working for the Journal ofAlzheimer's, Parkinsonism and Dementia as an editorial board member since 2016.
