<strong>Biographical Sketch</strong>

Minee is a neurophysiologist specialized in neurodegenerative diseases. She is an assistant professor at the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at KAIST. She is also an Honorary Fellow of UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and the Francis Crick Institute, UK. <br>

After obtaining BA and MMSc from Hanyang University, she was awarded Cambridge Overseas Trust Scholarship and earned her PhD in Clinical Neurosciences from the University of Cambridge (supervised by Prof. Roger Barker). After her doctorate, Minee moved to University College London (UCL) for her post-doctoral training (Sonia Gandhi's lab). She was on a laboratory secondment at the Francis Crick Institute as a senior research scientist. KAIST appointed her as an assistant professor as of Feb 2023. <br>

Minee was awarded the Amogen Rose Prize 2010, a best PhD student award of the department of clinical neuroscience, University of Cambridge. The British Royal Society of Biology acknowledged her achievements in neurodegeneration and nominated her as a new full member in 2019. She represented the post-doctoral fellows of the British Neuroscience Association in the committeefor BNA 2021 conference (2021). She also joined the grant and fellowship committee of the Athena Swan at the Crick Institute (2019 - 2022), the British female scientist empowerment programme. She has been working for the Journal of Alzheimer's, Parkinsonism and Dementia as an editorial board member since 2016. <br>

Minee's research aims to dissect cellular mechanisms of neurodegeneration and develop personalized therapeutic platforms for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. She extensively utilizes patient-derived pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) and machine learning-based high-throughput drug screening system. <br>

<strong>Major Field</strong>
- Human brain modelling for neurodegenerative diseases using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and organoids <br>
- Cell or non-cell autonomous mechanism in neurodegeneration including protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death <br>  
- AI-based drug screening <br>
