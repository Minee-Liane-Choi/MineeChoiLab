<strong>Biographical Sketch</strong>

Minee is a neurophysiologist specializing in neurodegenerative diseases. She currently serves as an assistant professor at the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at KAIST. Additionally, she holds the distinguished position of Honorary Fellow at both the UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology and the Francis Crick Institute in the UK. In 2024, she began working as an adjunct professor at Chang Gung University & Memorial Hospital.<br>

After obtaining BA and MMSc from Hanyang University, she received the prestigious Cambridge Overseas Trust Scholarship, which enabled her to pursue a PhD degree in Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Cambridge, under the supervision of a neurologist, Professor Roger Barker. She successfully completed her PhD in Clinical Neurosciences in 2013. <br>

Following her doctoral studies, Minee continued her research career as a post-doctoral research fellow at University College London (UCL), where she worked in the Professor John Wood's lab from 2013 to 2014 and later in the Professor Sonia Gandhi's lab from 2014 to 2022. During this time, she also undertook a laboratory secondment at the Francis Crick Institute as a senior research scientist from 2017 to 2022. In February 2023, she was appointed as an assistant professor at KAIST. <br>

Minee's research is centered on understanding of the mechanisms underlying protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Her work aims to dissect the cellular processes involved in neurodegeneration and develop personalized therapeutic approaches for AD and PD. She extensively employs patient-derived pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) systems, human cellular models for studying mitochondrial dysfunction and protein aggregation, as well as AI techniques. <br>

Throughout her academic career, Minee has earned recognition for her contributions. She received the Imogen Rose Prize in 2010, awarded for her outstanding doctoral work at the University of Cambridge. The British Royal Society of Biology acknowledged her achievements in the field of neurodegeneration, granting her full membership in 2019. In 2021, she represented post-doctoral fellows of the British Neuroscience Association in the committee for the BNA 2021 conference. Furthermore, she served on the grant and fellowship committee of the Athena Swan program at the Crick Institute from 2019 to 2022, contributing to the empowerment of British female scientists. Since 2016, she has been an editorial board member for the Journal of Alzheimer's, Parkinsonism, and Dementia. Since her appointment at KAIST in February 2023, she has achieved notable recognitions, including the KAIST Q-day Special Prize for Creative Talent in the same year and the KAIST Outstanding Lecture Award in 2024.
