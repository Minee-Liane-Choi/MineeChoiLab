Sir David Klenerman is a Professor of Biophysical Chemistry at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of Christ's College. He is best known for his work on next-generation sequencing of DNA (which subsequently resulted in Solexa, a high-speed DNA sequencing company that he co-founded), receiving the 2020 Millennium Technology Prize and a knighthood in the 2019 New Year Honours for his contribution to this field. Sir David has received a string of honours, including a 2018 Royal Medal from the Royal Society for his outstanding contribution to applied sciences, the 2020 Millenium and he was elected as a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences in 2015 and Fellow of the Royal Society in 2012. Most recently, his group is focusing on super-resolution microscopy to develop new insights on protein misfolding and neurodegenerative diseases, which is the subject of his new programme at the UK DRI.
